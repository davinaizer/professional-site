# TODO

## Purpose

This document tracks the current execution sequence derived from `ROADMAP.md`.

It does not redefine roadmap scope, architecture, or product requirements.

Tasks should be completed in order unless repository evidence or explicit developer direction justifies changing the sequence.

Each task should remain small enough to:

- plan independently;
- implement through code pairing;
- review against explicit acceptance criteria;
- complete without starting unrelated work.

Task boundaries should balance developer implementation effort with reliable AI-assisted review:

- Each task should have one primary objective and preferably no more than one material decision.
- Combine implementation with its direct acceptance checks; record those checks as task criteria rather than separate tasks.
- Separate product, architecture, content, or engineering decisions when they materially affect later implementation.
- Separate diagnosis or measurement from remediation when the remediation scope is not yet known.
- Keep the change surface and validation set small enough for `review-task` to assess completely from the approved plan and task-scoped evidence.
- Prefer a separate task when a failure would otherwise return several unrelated concerns to `code-pairing`.

## Milestone 5 — Evidence-Driven Evolution

The developer-requested UX review is sufficient evidence for the bounded refinement queue below. Do not add unrelated speculative features to this milestone.

### Priority UX Refinement Queue

This queue records the developer-requested UX craftsmanship review from 2026-09-16. It deliberately excludes a broad accessibility rework: the existing semantic, keyboard, focus, contrast, responsive, and automated-accessibility foundations are complete, and the current site scores 100 for accessibility in Lighthouse.

Complete these tasks in order. Preserve the restrained, content-first design and do not introduce decorative animation, additional product areas, or unnecessary dependencies.

The implementation and validation contract for this queue is recorded in `docs/plans/2026-09-16-ux-revamp.md`.

### 1. User Intent and UX Baseline — Complete

- [x] Treat the assumed recruiter, hiring-manager, engineer, and contact-ready journeys as hypotheses and map each one to its intended outcome, entry points, content needs, and likely continuation.
- [x] Inventory the current navigation, text links, primary actions, contact rows, resume download, project and experience links, and footer controls without changing their presentation.
- [x] Record current affordances, target boundaries, hover, active, focus-visible, visited-state relevance, accessible names, route outcomes, and representative keyboard order.
- [x] Capture a representative desktop, mobile, 200% zoom, reduced-motion, and font-loading baseline, distinguishing observed defects from unvalidated assumptions.
- [x] Produce a task-scoped findings record that confirms or narrows the remediation work below; do not implement speculative fixes during the baseline.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-09-16-ux-baseline.md`

Acceptance criteria:

- every proposed UX change traces to a named visitor intent or an observed interaction, content, accessibility, responsive, or performance issue;
- assumptions are labelled and are not presented as user-research findings;
- WCAG 2.2 target-size exceptions are applied correctly rather than treating every inline link as a button;
- Lighthouse and lab measurements are recorded as diagnostics, not claimed as field evidence; and
- the next remediation task is small enough for one implementation and review cycle.

### 2. Interaction Affordance Refinement

- [x] Use the approved baseline findings to normalise only inconsistent navigation, link, action, contact-row, resume-download, and footer interaction treatments.
- [x] Preserve persistent link affordances where context alone does not make interactivity clear, and ensure visual hit areas have unambiguous boundaries and destinations.
- [x] Add short state transitions only where they improve feedback, and provide an explicit reduced-motion fallback.
- [x] Verify that interaction feedback remains clear without relying on motion or colour alone and that existing accessible names and touch targets are preserved.

Acceptance criteria:

- equivalent interactions use equivalent visual feedback;
- state changes feel immediate and restrained rather than decorative;
- keyboard focus remains at least as clear as the current implementation;
- no layout shift, animated entrance, parallax, cursor effect, or new dependency is introduced; and
- relevant component tests and representative keyboard/pointer checks pass.

### 3. Reading Journey Continuity

- [x] Use the confirmed intent map to define the smallest useful set of contextual end-of-page links for the long-form Experience, Selected Projects, Case Studies, and Resume routes.
- [x] Implement one quiet, reusable continuation pattern that clearly names the destination and does not compete with the page content or global navigation.
- [x] Verify route behaviour, keyboard order, responsive wrapping, and deep-link compatibility.

Acceptance criteria:

- long pages no longer end without a useful next step;
- each destination follows the site's information architecture rather than forming a forced linear funnel;
- the pattern uses semantic links and existing typography, spacing, and accent tokens; and
- Home, Work, Contact, and the global footer are not duplicated unnecessarily.

### 4. Long-Form Reading Rhythm and Content Resilience

- [x] Review Experience, Selected Projects, and Case Studies together for paragraph measure, heading separation, metadata hierarchy, section rhythm, and narrow-screen density.
- [ ] Test realistic stress cases including long headings, long link labels, fallback fonts, overridden text spacing, and content reflow at 320 CSS pixels.
- [ ] Correct only demonstrated inconsistencies using existing tokens and shared patterns before adding any new token or component.
- [ ] Verify representative desktop, mobile, 200% zoom, and reduced-motion layouts without changing approved professional copy.

Acceptance criteria:

- narrative copy, supporting metadata, and evidence sections remain visually distinct;
- readable line lengths and hierarchy are preserved across representative widths;
- repeated structures have consistent spacing without flattening meaningful hierarchy; and
- no content claim or evidence boundary changes as part of the visual pass.

### 5. Not-Found Experience Polish

- [x] Bring the existing not-found route into the established editorial visual language.
- [x] Add concise orientation and one clear route back to useful content without adding novelty, illustration, or unnecessary choices.
- [x] Add or update the focused route test and verify direct entry to an unknown URL.

Acceptance criteria:

- the page feels intentional and consistent with the rest of the site;
- visitors can recover with one obvious action;
- the response remains concise, accessible, and responsive; and
- the route introduces no special-case shell or dependency.

## Post-MVP Publication Follow-up

These tasks are intentionally separate from the approved application scope. Complete them when the production domain and publication window are confirmed.

### Publication Metadata

- [x] Add a production meta description.
- [x] Add the canonical URL after confirming the production domain.
- [x] Add Open Graph and social-preview metadata and an approved preview image.
- [x] Add favicon and site-icon assets.
- [x] Decide and implement the production indexing policy, including `robots.txt` and a sitemap if required.

### Live Production Verification

- [x] Verify direct entry and refresh behaviour for all client-side routes on the current Cloudflare Pages preview deployment.
- [x] Verify the resume download, email, LinkedIn, project, case-study, and experience-anchor links on the current Cloudflare Pages preview deployment.
- [x] Re-run route and link verification after the current changes are merged to the Cloudflare Pages production branch.
- [x] Run production performance, accessibility, SEO, and best-practice measurements.
- [ ] Review representative production layouts in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
- [ ] Verify production focus visibility and colour contrast in real browsers.
- [ ] Confirm whether externally hosted Google Fonts remain acceptable for production reliability, privacy, and rendering performance.

## Backlog Rules

Do not add a backlog item solely because it may be useful later.

Before adding work, identify:

1. the current problem;
2. the evidence that the problem exists;
3. the product objective it supports;
4. why it should be addressed now rather than deferred.

If those cannot be stated clearly, do not add the task.
