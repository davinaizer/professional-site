# Decisions

## Use React Router v8 in Data Mode — 2026-08-09 23:43 BST

**Decision:** Use React Router v8 in Data Mode for client-side routing, with route objects, `createBrowserRouter`, and `RouterProvider`.

**Rationale:** The product requires multiple durable MVP routes and shared navigation. React Router is an established routing solution that integrates with the existing React and Vite foundation while providing relevant practice with modern routing concepts. Data Mode establishes a maintainable route configuration and supports future loaders, actions, pending states, and error boundaries without requiring those capabilities before a concrete need exists.

Adopting Next.js solely for its routing system would replace the current application architecture and revisit completed foundation work. The product does not currently require its server rendering, Server Component, or full-stack capabilities, so that migration would be disproportionate to the present routing requirement.

**Deferred:** Loaders, actions, and other data-routing capabilities will be introduced only when required by a route. A framework migration may be reconsidered if future product requirements demonstrate a need for rendering or server capabilities that the existing architecture cannot serve proportionally.

## Use Biome for baseline linting and formatting — 2026-08-07 18:00 BST

**Decision:** Use Biome as the project's baseline linter and formatter while retaining TypeScript for type checking.

**Rationale:** Biome provides the required linting, formatting, and import organisation through one dependency and one configuration file. This keeps the initial quality foundation proportional to the current application while preserving separate, explicit TypeScript validation.

**Deferred:** Testing tools and their package scripts will be selected when the testing approach is defined.
