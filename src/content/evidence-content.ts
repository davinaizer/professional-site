		engineering:
			"View models held the screen state; use cases and dependency injection kept business logic decoupled from presentation; repositories, DTO mapping, and API services handled data access. Idea capture checked for empty details and possible duplicates before submitting. Recommendation generation could take time, so the feed showed generating, awaiting, ready, and error states. The app checked for results periodically and handled real-time updates. Authentication and deep links connected entry and return paths to application state. A person could accept or dismiss a recommendation. When they chose to schedule one, the app carried the idea and recommendation into event creation.
